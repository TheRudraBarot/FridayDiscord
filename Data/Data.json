You\u2019ve trusted people who chose to let you down over and over. Today, the cards are reminding you to make that paradigm shift. To begin to honour your inner light. To look at the deity in the mirror and remind them of their inherent beauty, grace and wisdom. You deserve more than yet another half-love. You deserve to be with somebody who is committed to building a life with you and promises to stand by you through the most turbulent of storms.",

Give this connection the time it needs to unfold as it must. There is a lot you will discover about your own love language in the process. When it comes to your creative pursuits, you\u2019re being asked to dedicate yourself to what brings you joy. Perfection is an illusion created by the human mind.
